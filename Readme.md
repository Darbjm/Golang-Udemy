<h2>What I enjoy</h2>
<br/>
I love how you can build programmes using fundemental building blocks from go libraries. I feel it's easier to be creative working this way.<br/>
I've only worked with OOP languages before but I Golangs method of functional programming easy to understand.<br/>
A new concept to me was creating functions specifically for a type. I love this as I can see how it will reduce mistakes and make the code more orderly for everyone else.
